## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Hot pink (#FF00FF) for a vibrant, energetic 90s feel. It evokes the boldness and playfulness associated with that era.
- Background color: Desaturated purple (#2D0B69), darkened to black (#000000), creates contrast and a dark, mysterious atmosphere, reminiscent of 90s websites. 
- Accent color: Electric blue (#00FFFF) for interactive elements to highlight key actions and navigation.
- Font: 'Orbitron' (sans-serif) for main headings and titles, captures a sci-fi retro vibe; 'Courier New' as the monospace fallback.
- Use 8-bit style icons for suspects, weapons, and locations. Make sure the icons fit inside the UI components, like the navigation modals and logic grid.
- Implement a split-screen dashboard with the story panel on the left and the deduction grid on the right, creating a functional workspace, where navigation uses large, beveled 3D buttons.
- Incorporate animated rainbow gradients, blinking text, and neon glow effects to capture the visual effects from 90s websites.
