      title: "The Serpent's Shadow",
      setting: "Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Gothic estate shrouded in mist and secrets, perched on a cliff overlooking a stormy sea.",
      atmosphere: "A palpable tension hangs in the air, thick with unspoken rivalries and old money. Rain lashes against the stained-glass windows, and the distant cry of a lighthouse echoes the manor's isolation.",
      intro: "The annual Blackwood gala was the event of the season, but its glittering facade shattered when the host, Lord Alistair Blackwood, a ruthless industrialist with a venomous reputation, was found dead in his private study. A single, clean puncture wound marked his chest. The storm has trapped the remaining guests in the manor, turning a night of celebration into a theater of suspicion. The killer walks among them.",

The argument escalated, and in a moment of cold fury, Silas grabbed the nearest object - the letter opener on the desk - and stabbed Alistair, staging it to look like a suicide before slipping out unnoticed.",
      reveal_narrative: "It was a crime of desperation, committed by a man of pride. Silas Croft, pushed to the brink, saw only one way out. He confronted his old partner in the heart of his power, the Study. The letter opener, a symbol of the very correspondence that built their empire, became the instrument of its bloody end. It was a direct, calculated act, befitting a man who had spent his life in the cutthroat world of business."
