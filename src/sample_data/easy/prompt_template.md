## **Simplified Generation Prompt**

**You are a master puzzle designer creating a Murdle-style logic puzzle game. Generate a complete murder mystery following this exact structure:**

### **Theme: `{theme}`**
Create a cohesive murder mystery with **{theme}** as the central concept. Intelligently design all elements to fit this theme:

- **Characters**: Choose 3 character types that naturally belong in **{theme}** setting
- **Locations**: Design 3 places that logically exist within **{theme}** environment  
- **Weapons**: Select 3 implements that would realistically be found in **{theme}** context
- **Story Elements**: All descriptions and clues should reinforce **{theme}** atmosphere

### **Difficulty Level: `{difficulty_level}`**
- **Beginner**: 2-3 logical steps, mostly direct assignments and simple elimination
- **Intermediate**: 4-5 logical steps, include professional logic and relationships  
- **Advanced**: 6+ logical steps, conditional reasoning and complex constraints
- **Expert**: Multi-layered elimination with professional contradictions and either/or logic

### **Smart Theme Integration:**
The AI should automatically determine appropriate:
- Character professions that fit **{theme}**
- Weapon types suitable for **{theme}** setting
- Location varieties matching **{theme}** environment
- Clue styles that work well with **{theme}** context
- Writing tone that complements **{theme}** atmosphere

**Available Clue Types:**
1. **Direct Assignment**: "Character X has Item Y"
2. **Location Discovery**: "Body/evidence found at Location Z"  
3. **Environmental Evidence**: "Physical traces link elements"
4. **Negative Constraint**: "Item X not at Location Y"
5. **Professional Logic**: "Behavior matches character background"
6. **Relationship Logic**: "Characters share history/connections"
7. **Either/Or Logic**: "Either Condition A or Condition B"
8. **Coded Information**: "Encrypted messages requiring decryption"
9. **Sensory Evidence**: "Smell/sound/visual environmental cues"

### **Logical Complexity: `{logical_complexity}`**
Structure the puzzle requiring exactly **{logical_complexity}** deductive steps:
- Each clue must be necessary for solution
- Progressive revelation through logical chains
- Exactly one valid solution path
- Strategic use of negative vs positive information

### **Writing Style Requirements:**
- **Simple Language**: Use common vocabulary, avoid complex or literary words
- **Short Sentences**: Maximum 15-20 words per sentence, clear and direct
- **Dark Humor**: Include subtle comedy and ironic observations like original Murdle games
- **Accessible Tone**: Write for global audience, especially non-native English speakers
- **Punchy Descriptions**: Brief, memorable character and location descriptions
- **Clear Logic**: Clues must be straightforward and unambiguous

**Example Original Murdle Style:**
- "A magician who perfected the sawing-your-husband-in-two routine. Then, she made his body disappear."
- "He drives a BMW. He has a staff of twenty-five. He's taken a vow of chastity, too, which is why he's on vacation."
- "Just a regular, ordinary brick. Nothing special. Just a brick."

### **Quality Standards:**
- **Thematic Coherence**: All elements naturally fit **{theme}** 
- **Logical Consistency**: Single unique solution reachable through deduction
- **Accessible Writing**: Simple, clear language suitable for international audience
- **Character Authenticity**: Professional behaviors create realistic constraints
- **Puzzle Balance**: Appropriate complexity for **{difficulty_level}**
